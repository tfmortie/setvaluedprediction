# Uncertainty-aware classification with set-valued predictions

Package for utility-based set-valued prediction in flat and hierarchical classification. 

## Description

This package provides different set-valued predictors for flat and hierarchical classification with support for Scikit-learn and PyTorch.

**TODO**: support for multi-label classification.

## Installation

Clone this repository [`tfmortie/setvaluedprediction`](https://github.com/tfmortie/setvaluedprediction.git) and run `pip install . -r requirements.txt`
